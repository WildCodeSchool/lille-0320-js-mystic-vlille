# P2 cursus React/Node

Deployed on : https://vlilleapp.netlify.app/

Context : Our client (false client but a real teacher) wanted a web app of Lille bicycle's stations (V'Lille). He wanted to know in real time the availability of bikes and stations.

API : We used MEL's [API](https://opendata.lillemetropole.fr/explore/dataset/vlille-realtime/information/)

Work : React, Material UI and an open data map (Leaflet).

Team : We were 6 at the beginning (4 at the end). We used Scrum Method (Poker planning, Product Backlog, Sprint review).
Each week, we changed the Product Owner and the Scrum Master. In that way, all members of team tested these status.

Workflow: Two reviewes were necessary to push a feature on dev branch.
